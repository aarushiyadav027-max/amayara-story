      <h2>Chapter 1: A New Beginning</h2>
      <p>Amayara had never wanted to leave home. The thought of staying in a hostel, far from her parents’ care, filled her with dread. Cold hallways, strangers everywhere, and rigid routines seemed unbearable. But she had no choice. With a deep breath, she dragged her suitcase through the hostel gates, carrying her world inside.</p>
      <p>The first days were the hardest. Meals were quiet, rooms were unfamiliar, and the laughter of others felt distant. Slowly, she noticed small comforts: sunlight spilling through windows, the quiet library, and tiny victories learning to navigate her new life.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Chapter 2: Faces in the Crowd</h2>
      <p>It was here she met her eight “friends” and Kiara. The friends smiled, whispered secrets, and called her their friend, yet Amayara often felt their friendliness was superficial.</p>
      <p>Kiara was different—confident, athletic, and admired by everyone. At first, she seemed kind, but her true colors soon appeared. Kiara couldn’t dance like Amayara, and envy turned into subtle sabotage: whispers, snide remarks, and small lies. But Amayara clung to her passion, practicing late at night, letting dance be her escape.</p>

      <h2>Chapter 3: The Talent Show</h2>
      <p>The hostel’s annual talent show approached. Amayara felt nervous but determined. Kiara watched, eyes sharp, plotting quietly. Her eight friends hovered, some supportive, some distant. Lavanya, Priya, and Anika quietly cheered her on, giving Amayara hope.</p>
      <p>On stage, Amayara danced. Every twirl, leap, and graceful fall told her story—the struggle, loneliness, whispers, and jealousy. The audience was mesmerized. When she finished, applause thundered. Kiara’s face was unreadable, while her real friends quietly smiled with pride. For the first time, Amayara realized her passion spoke louder than envy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 4: Finding Her Place</h2>
      <p>After the talent show, Amayara began to understand her true friends. Lavanya, Priya, and Anika stayed by her side. The others—Naina, Rhea, Sonia, Meera, and Tanya—remained friendly but distant. She learned not everyone needs to be your anchor; some are just passing stars.</p>
      <p>Kiara no longer sabotaged, but neither did she offer friendship. Amayara realized she didn’t need her approval—her passion was enough. The hostel, once a cage, became a stage where she found her voice, her strength, and friends who truly mattered. She danced freely, fully alive, entirely free.</p>
